# FizzBuzz
## Requirements
### 1.0
Create a console app that prints out the first 100 terms generated by playing the childrens counting game *FizzBuzz*.

This version is done with very simple Java code designed for basic practice. There is no object orientation (just a single `main` class). It introduces the idea of modulus for determining when one number is divisible by another.

### Possible future versions
Accepts user input specifying the number of terms.
