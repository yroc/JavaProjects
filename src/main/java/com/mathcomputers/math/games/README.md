# FizzBuzz
>FizzBuzz is a game I learned long ago in elementary school French class as a way to practice counting in that language. The players take turns counting, starting with one and going up. The rules are simple: when your turn arrives, you say the next number. However, if that number is a multiple of five, you say "fizz" instead. If the number is a multiple of seven, you say "buzz." And if the number is a multiple of both, you say "fizzbuzz."
## Requirements
### 1.0
Write a console app that prints out the first 100 terms generated by playing the childrens counting game *FizzBuzz*.

This version is done with very simple Java code designed for basic practice. There is no object orientation (just a single `main` class). It introduces the idea of modulus for determining when one number is divisible by another.

### Possible future versions
Accepts user input specifying the number of terms to print.
