# FibonacciSequence
The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each successive number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence begins with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,â€¦ This sequence appears in interesting places in nature. For example, the number of petals on most species of flowers is one of the Fibonacci numbers.
## Requirements
### 1.0
Write a console app that prints out the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence (assume the initial two elements in the sequence is 1, 1).
### Possible future versions
* Accept user input specifying the number of terms to print
* Use recursion to generate the terms of the sequence

# Addends
## Requirements
### 1.0
Write a console app that receives the set of integers `[1, 2, 5, 6, 17]` and the integer `23` and returns the pair of integers in the set that sum to 23 (namely, `6` and `17`).
### Possible future versions
* Accept user input specifying a set of integers and a sum, and return any pair of integers in the set that add to the given sum.
