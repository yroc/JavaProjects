# Sequences
The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each successive number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first few numbers of the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,â€¦ This sequence appears in interesting places in nature. For example, the number of petals on most species of flowers is one of the Fibonacci numbers.
## Requirements
### 1.0
Write a console app called Sequences that contains a method, call it `fibonacci`, that prints out the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence (assume the initial two elements in the sequence is 1, 1).
### Possible future versions
* Modify `fibonacci()` so that it accepts user input specifying the number of terms to print
* Modify `fibonacci()` so that it uses recursion to generate the terms of the sequence
* Add additional methods that print out other mathematical sequences

# Addends
## Requirements
### 1.0
Write a console app that receives the set of integers `[1, 2, 5, 6, 17]` and the integer `23` and returns the pair of integers in the set that sum to 23 (namely, `6` and `17`).
### Possible future versions
* Accept user input specifying a set of integers and a sum, and return any pair of integers in the set that add to the given sum.
