# FibonacciSequence
## Requirements
### 1.0
Create a console app that prints out the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence (assume the first element in the sequence is 1).
### Possible future versions
* Accept user input that specifies the number of terms to print out
* Use recursion to generate the terms of the sequence

# Addends
## Requirements
### 1.0
Create a console app that accepts the set of integers `[1, 2, 5, 6, 17]` and the sum `23` and returns the pair of integers in the set that sum to 23 (namely, `6` and `17`).
### Possible future versions
* Accept user input that specifies a set of integers and a sum, and return any pair of integers in the set that add to the given sum
