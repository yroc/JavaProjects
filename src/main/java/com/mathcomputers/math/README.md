# FibonacciSequence
In the initial version, prints out the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Possible future versions may take user input to specify the number of terms to print out and may use recursion to generate the terms of the sequence.
# Addends
In the initial version, accepts the set of integers `[1, 2, 5, 6, 17]` and the sum `23` and returns the pair of integers in the set that sum to 23. A possible future version may accept a given set of integers and a given sum, and return any pair of integers in the set that sum to the given sum
